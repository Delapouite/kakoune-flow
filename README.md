# kakoune-flow

[kakoune](http://kakoune.org) plugin to work with [flow](https://flow.org/), the JavaScript type checker.

## Install

- `flow-get-type`:Â display the type of the name under cursor in info (using `flow type-at-pos`)
- `flow-jump-to-definition`: jump to definition of the name under cursor (using `flow get-def`)
- `flow-coverage`: display the current file coverage in info and highlight missing coverage (using `flow coverage`)
- `flow-coverage-disable`: remove coverage highlighter
- `flow-select-references`: select references of the name under cursor (using `flow find-refs`)
